    <h3>nwes</h3>
    <p>The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins
       with a consonant. It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel.
        The indefinite article indicates
      that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. For example,
       you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” Your friend
       will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item.
        “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. Again, the indefinite article
        indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. Your friend probably
         doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns.
          Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:</p>
